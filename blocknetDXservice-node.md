## Exchange Decentralizzato Blocknet Configurazione Del Nodo Di Servizio

**Queste istruzioni devono essere eseguite come nodo di servizio per l'exchange decentralizzato Blocknet.** 

* Il DX di Blocknet usa la tecnologia blockchain router xbridgep2p™ per consentire agli utenti di scambiare monete e assets, e utilizzare contratti smart tra blockchains.

## Panoramica
La configurazione richiede un'integrazione tra il wallet Blocknet e il wallet delle monete volute come coppia di valuta. A questo punto, niente é automatizzato e la UI sul nuovo wallet Blocknet sará usata fino a che la UI finale non sia completa. Configurazione creata manualmente (o modifiche) .conf dei files:  

 * blocknetdx.conf
 
 * servicenode.conf

 * xbridge.conf

 * file di configurazione per ogni valuta si desidera supportare

L'integrazione avviene tramite le API RPC del wallet. Per ragioni di sicurezza raccomandiamo di eseguire tutti i wallets su un'unica box e comunicare su localhost (127.0.0.1), anche se i wallets possono anche essere eseguiti su macchine differenti ed essere connessi tramite indirizzo IP. La documentazione generale e le funzionalitá JSON RPC sono disponibili a https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin.

## Requirements
* Two computers with the latest Blocknet client installed, encrypted, fully synced
   * Computer #1 will be the Service Node Server which will need to be running 24/7
      * This guide will refer to this computer as the " SNODE SERVER "
      
   * Computer #2 will be the client computer where the 5000 Block is locked. This doesn't need to run 24/7.
      * This guide will refer to this computer as the " CLIENT "

* Your SNODE SERVER computer Public IP address. Or the Public IP address if you're using a VPS/VPN for the SNODE SERVER computer.

* 5000 Block to be locked into a service node address on the CLIENT computer (the 5000 Block cannot stake while it is locked)

* The latest wallet of each currency you want to support on your service node (fully synced, encrypted)

* Properly configured .conf files for each wallet


## Service Node Setup

* Download the latest wallet release on two computers or VPS 
   * [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/BlockDX/releases)
   
* On each computer let the wallet fully sync. Once that is complete encrypt both wallets with a password of your choice
   * If you are testing please use `testnet=1` or `-testnet` for `blocknetdx-qt.exe`
   
### CLIENT Computer Wallet Setup   
   
* Navigate the top toolbar to: `Tools > Debug console`
   * Type `getaccountaddress <name>` (This generates a public address key for your service node. Create a unique service node name.)
      * Ex: `getaccountaddress snode01`
      
   * Type `servicenode genkey` (This generates and outputs your service node private key)
   
   * Take note of these generated outputs as they will be needed in the configuration files
   
* Whichever wallet your funds are located in send exactly 5000 Block (tBlock if on testnet) to the public address you created on the previous step
   * The address needs to have EXACTLY 5000 Block (or tBLock) to work properly
   
   * Under the "Send" option, click the "Choose..." button beside the Transaction Fee option. When you send the 5000 Block, ensure "Send as zero-fee transaction if possible" is checked off. 
   
![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/send_5000.PNG "Logo Title Text 1")
   
* Wait for the CLIENT computer to receive the 5000 Block and have at least 15 confirmations on the TX

* Once the TX is fully confirmed navigate back to: `Tools > Debug console`
   * Type `servicenode outputs` (This outputs the servicenode TX information needed in the `servicenode.conf`)
   
   * Take note of these generated outputs as they will be needed in the configuration files
   
* Now you need to retrieve your SNODE SERVER computer Public IP address. If you only use one Public IP address, go to Google and search "what's my ip". Your Public IP address will be displayed. Take note of this address as it will be needed in the configuration files
   * If you're using a VPN or VPS for the SNODE SERVER computer, you need to retrieve that Public IP address.
   * Main-net users use YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:41412
   * Test-net users use YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:41474
   
* Navigate to your Blocknet data directory (default is: `%appdata%/roaming/blocknetdx/`)
   * Create/edit the `servicenode.conf` file (`/blocknetdx/testnet4/` for testnet users)
   
   * There should be an example of how the configuration needs to be in this file: (You can delete this after yours is typed in)
   ![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/snode_conf_ex.PNG "Logo Title Text 1")
   
   * Enter your generated information from above in the format shown in this example:
   ```
   snode01 <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:41474> <YOUR_SERVICENODE_PRIVATE_KEY> <COLLATERAL_TX_OUTPUT> <TX_OUTPUT_INDEX>
   ```
   
   * Save `servicenode.conf` 
   
   * Create/edit `blocknetdx.conf`. Add `staking=0`. Save `blocknetdx.conf`
  
   * Restart the wallet. Fully unlock the wallet.
   
### SNODE SERVER Computer Wallet Setup

* Navigate to your Blocknet data directory (default is: `%appdata%/roaming/blocknetdx/`)
   * Create/edit the `blocknetdx.conf` file
     * If you are using testnet, `blocknetdx.conf` needs to stay in `%appdata%/roaming/blocknetdx/` and NOT in the `/testnet4/` folder
     
   * Type the following information into your `blocknetdx.conf` file: (use staking=1 if you want to stake on the SNODE SERVER client)
   
   ```
   staking=1
   servicenode=1
   servicenodeaddr=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:41412
   servicenodeprivkey=YOUR_SERVICENODE_PRIVATE_KEY
   ```
   
   * Save the `blocknetdx.conf` and restart the wallet. Fully unlock the wallet.
   
### Starting Service Node(s)

* On the CLIENT computer navigate to the "Servicenodes" button on the GUI. If the setups were done correctly you should see all of your "Aliases"

#### Activate via Debug Console

* Navigate to `Tools > Debug console`

* Type: `servicenode start-alias <name>` Ex: `servicenode start-alias snode1`

* The status of your node(s) should be "ENABLED" and show an "Active time"
   * It may take a moment to show enabled and/or an active time.
   
![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/snode_alias.PNG "Logo Title Text 1")    
   
* Your Service Node(s) are running successfully. You can close off the CLIENT computer Blocknet wallet if you want.  
   
* The CLIENT computer will receive the " Servicenode Rewards "


### Status Checks

* On the SNODE SERVER computer navigate the top toolbar to: `Tools > Debug console`
   * Type `servicenode debug` (This will output a message "Servicenode successfully started")
   
   * Type `servicenode status` (This will output your service node information and a successful message at the end of it)
   
  ![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/snode_status.PNG "Logo Title Text 1")    
   
* If you did not receive "Servicenode successfully started" proceed to the next "Troubleshooting section"

* If you received a "Servicenode successfully started" proceed to setup your .conf files for the wallets on your service node
   
   
### Troubleshooting

* Ensure your `servicenode.conf` information is correct to your settings

* Ensure you don't have "< >" in any of the configuration files : (ex: `servicenodeaddr=<your_public_IP:41474>` should be `servicenodeaddr=127.0.0.1:41412`. "127.0.0.1 is an example IP address")
   * Ensure you are using the correct P2P PORT #
     * Main-net=`41412` 
     * Test-net=`41474`

* Ensure on the CLIENT computer you only have a `servicenode.conf`, the `blocknetdx.conf` is not needed on the CLIENT computer
   * For testnet ensure `servicenode.conf` is located in `/testnet4/`

* Ensure on the SNODE SERVER computer you only have a `blocknetdx.conf`, the `servicenode.conf` is not needed on the SNODE SERVER computer
   * For testnet ensure `blocknetdx.conf` is located in `/blocknetdx/` and not `/testnet4/`
   * If you are a tester, there will be a CMD line startup guide so you don't have to edit this configuration when you switch from main-net and test-net
   
* Ensure your configuration files are not `servicenode.conf.txt`

* Ensure the 5000 Block is exactly 5000 Block, no more or no less and ensure it's confirmed

* Ensure you have the latest wallet and that it's fully sync'd and fully unlocked

## Setup  .conf Files for the Wallets on Your Service Node:
The wallet of each coin you want to host needs to be configured with a username/password and an allow from IP, if you’re using only a local machine use IP:127.0.0.1

 * To see the full list of compatible wallet configurations go to: [Wallet Configurations](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/walletsCONF.md)

 * Download the latest wallet, let it sync up fully, then close the wallet

 * Click the START button on your desktop, where it says “Search program and files” then type “%appdata%” and the “Roaming” directory should pop up. Click on “Roaming” or hit enter

 * Find your wallet’s designated data directory folder, ex: Bitcoin

 * If you don’t have a .conf file started you will need to open up Notepad to create one.

 * Navigate to [Wallet Configurations](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/walletsCONF.md) and copy/paste the configuration information for the wallet you are running. (this can be added to what is already present in file if you have “addnodes” or other configurations already):
   * Ex: bitcoin.conf
   
   ```
   server=1
   listen=1
   rpcuser=yourusername
   rpcpassword=yourpassword
   rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
   ```
   
   * Ensure the configuration is correct. Do not assume the configurations are the same for each wallet.

 * Change `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` to something unique to you. For security reasons you should have a different RPC username and password for each wallet

 * If you’re using a single machine use IP: `127.0.0.1`

 * When you are done, click File, Save as, Type in: `bitcoin.conf`
    * Ensure the file is not `bitcoin.conf.txt`

 * Save it and then place the .conf into its corresponding wallet folder
    * For this example: %Appdata%/Roaming/Bitcoin 

 * Remember what you wrote for the username, password, and IP

 * Create .conf files for each wallet you are going to be using on the decentralised exchange.
    * Ensure `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` are different on each wallet for security purposes
 
---

## Configure Coin Addresses
In each hosted coin wallet, create a new address and label it something informative, like “DX address” (xbridge expects a labelled receive address)

 * To create a new address, go to your wallet’s “receive” tab and click “new address”

 * To label an address, you may either right-click on it or click the “label” field.
 
 ![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/labelledaddress.PNG "Logo Title Text 1") 

 * This needs to be done for all wallets being used

---

## Setup xbridge.conf

The Blocknet’s Xbridge technology is integrated into the latest client release. See [GitHub](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/BlockDX) for the source code.

 * To see the full list of coin .conf's see: [xbridge.conf](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/xbridgeCONF.md)

 * Create/edit an `xbridge.conf` file and place the following configuration file in the blocknet wallet data directory (for Windows) C:\Users\[yourusername]\AppData\Roaming\blocknetdx\

 * Note: to avoid crashes or failed trades, please edit your `xbridge.conf` to feature only and all the coins you wish to have on your service node

 * Paste the RPC usernames and passwords you created for each currency pair into the “Username” and “Password” fields
 
 * Paste the address of the "labelled receive address" you created for each currency pair
 
 * Ensure the rest of the configuration matches [xbridge.conf](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/xbridgeCONF.md) for each coin

 * Save the File (if you just edited the existing file, just click save, if you made a new file then click file, save as, and in the file name type: `xbridge.conf`
    * Ensure the file is not `xbridge.conf.txt`

 * Place this file into the Blocknet data directory folder: "C:\Users\[yourusername]\AppData\Roaming\blocknetdx\"

 * You will be coming back to this to edit it in the future to add future coins, and change `RPCusername` `RPCpassword` `Port` `Address` 
 
 * Do not change the other settings in the .conf file unless you are on testnet conducting tests.
 
---

## Startup Sequence
 * Start the currency pair(s) you are running on your service node
    * Ensure every wallet is fully sync'd and unlocked
    

 * Start the Blocknet wallet on the SNODE SERVER computer with `-enableexchange`
    * ex: blocknetdx-qt.exe -enableexchange

 * If you want to always start in exchange mode, right click on desktop/folder icon of your node blocknetdx-qt. Then choose properties. Then change "...blocknetdx-qt.exe" to "...blocknetdx-qt.exe -enableexchange". Save. Now it always start with these attributes.
 
     * When you click the "BlocknetDX" tab on the wallet it should say "Exchange node".
     * In the console type: `dxGetCurrencyList` to show your list of wallets running on your xbridge
     * In the console type: `servicenode list`, search for your SNODE, under `xwallets` it will show the wallets you are hosting
       
 * Ensure your servicenode is activated.
  
---

## Verify communication between wallets.
In order to ensure that the xbridge client is communicating with your wallets and the .conf files are setup properly, navigate to the Blocknet data dir: C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\blocknetdx\

   * Open the "log" folder. Open up the log file with the current date/time. Ex: `xbridgep2p_20170831T181856.log`
   * Each log file will update until the client instance is close. If a new client instance is opened a new log file will be created.

As the wallet starts up, you’ll see the DX initialise using the values you entered into your `xbridge.conf` file:

![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/dxstart.PNG "Logo Title Text 1") 

 * Wait until you see “HTTP: resp 200” messages. This signifies that the wallets are communicating over RPC and setup has been successful. Ensure each wallet you are running displays a “HTTP: resp 200” and displays your labelled receive address name.
 
 ![alt text](https://github.com/BlocknetDX/blocknet-docs/blob/master/pictures/resp_200.PNG "Logo Title Text 1") 

 * Note: If, amidst the “HTTP: resp 200” messages, you see a message similar to `[I] 2017-Apr-19 17:48:31 [0x2],listaccounts exception couldn't connect to server`, then it is likely that at least one of your specified trading wallets have not been run.

 * Note: If you fail to get “HTTP: resp 200” messages, it’s possible that the ports assigned to wallets differ from those specified in your .conf file. To check this, open Command Prompt, type `netstat -an`, and take a look which ports are being used over localhost (127.0.0.1), or sometimes over 0.0.0.0.
 
---

## Problem Diagnosis
* To verify that each wallet is communicating with xbridge make sure the created receive addresses for each wallet is listed in the address book. If this part fails, close your wallets and review their configuration files.

* If you made changes to any .conf file you need to close and restart that wallet, including Blocknet 

* Verify the ports are actually open. You may use Command Prompt to do so by typing in `netstat -an` and reviewing the print. Check that the ports you specified in the .conf files (ex: 8332 for Bitcoin) are open over localhost (127.0.0.1).

* Ensure all .conf files are configured properly. These configurations are very case-sensitive. Any wrong data entered in them could be causing the issues.

* Check that no OS-based firewall is blocking communication. You may do this through your firewall’s interface.

* Check the xbridge log for any errors in: C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\blocknetdx\log

* Check on general wallet events in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\walletname\debug.log
